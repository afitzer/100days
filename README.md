### There was a huge discount on like every udemy course, so I bought a python bootcamp called 100days of code for $12 :money_mouth_face:	

So far, the course I took on Coursera from the University of Michigan was better. But this course will force me to complete small projects and help me practice. I'm definitely not creative enough to come up with these on my own. The later days do get into topics that the UMich course didn't cover so I'm looking forward to what's to come :boom:
