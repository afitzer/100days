### There was a huge discount on like every udemy course, so I bought a python bootcamp called 100days of code for $12 :money_mouth_face:	

So far, the [python for everybody course](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/7RMQA3BNZTS4) I completed on Coursera from the University of Michigan was better. That suggested us to use Atom and actually explained the importance of being able to use the command line.  But this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) uses some B.S. website called repl. However the course will force me to complete small projects that I'm definitely not creative enough to come up with these on my own. The code is garbage so far but the later days do get into topics that the UMich course didn't cover (pandas, numpy, plotly, flask) so I'm looking forward to what's to come :boom:
